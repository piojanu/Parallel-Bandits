# Parallel Bandits

Take a parallel Bandits algorithm with the problem it was used on, implement it in OMP, and run on different processors in different configurations (num. of CPUs, num. of threads, hyper-threading, AVX, etc.). We aim to benchmark trade-offs in running time and energy used and describe them in 4 pages paper.
